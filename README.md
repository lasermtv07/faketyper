Note: This is a beta and it is NOT SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE FULL PRODUCT! I only wanna backup it here as Im gonna have to rewrite a big chunk of it,
      because the code is pretty bad. But if u use it anyway and find a bug, please report it using GitHub issues
      Also dont look at it unless you wanna add it to your cringe compilation.
      Your Laser =)
